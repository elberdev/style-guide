## Engineering Vision

## Review Principles
  
  - **It's about the team**: When giving criticism, nothing is the committer’s fault. If there is a problem in a commit, it’s everyone’s problem in our codebase, and it’s everyone’s responsibility to rectify. 

  - **Focus on the substance**: It could be easy to get caught up with formatting and semantics. However we should try to leave that to automation as much as possible. The focus should be having a solid understanding of the logic to a point that it feels comfortable to contribute to the same piece of code.

  - **Make it a learning opportunity**: We all have something to learn from others, draw value from reading other people's code and collaborating with each other.

## Review Etiquette
  
  - **Criticism**: Code review shouldn't be an opportunity to show technical superiority over other people, it's about iterate on solutions and make each other better.
  
  - **Compliments**: Code review shouldn't be just about finding errors or constructive feedback, it's also a great place to promote good engineering. So do not shy away from giving your teammate a shout-out when you see brilliant thinking.

## Review Flow

  - Each review should be an open and ongoing conversation:
    - For new features or formats, mark it as "WIP" in Gitlab. Such PR may last over the course of sprint(s) and has various check points in the converstion.
    - For bug fix or quick tweaks, create pull request the normal way. Such PR shouldn't contain too many lines of code changes.
  - Continuously push commits to remote, ask for feedback early instead of lump them together in the end.
  - For major features, merge production code to feature branch often to ensure backwards compatibility.
  - When in doubt, pair programming or schedule quick review sessions.
  - All code should be well-tested and well-documented during the review process.

## Branching Strategy
